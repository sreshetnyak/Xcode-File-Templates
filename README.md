## Setup Guide:

### Using script | With adding templates in one folder
Only need execute this command in terminal:

```
sudo swift install.swift
```

You should see one of such kind of output message:
``` 
âœ…  Template installed succesfully ðŸŽ‰. Enjoy it ðŸ™‚"
âœ…  Template already exists. So has been replaced succesfully ðŸŽ‰. Enjoy it ðŸ™‚
```

### Manual | With Saving Folder structure
1. Open folder Templates/File Template from downloaded or cloned repository. 
2. Go to direction ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/ and set folders with templates
3. If direction ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/ already has folder Templates and File Templates, just use the following folder named MVVM Templates and paste it into File Templates folder.

## Usage guide:
- CMD+N -> and choose Template which you need
- New -> File -> and choose Template which you need
